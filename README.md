 The Problem

**60% of all crypto losses are due to lost keys, not hacks.**

- Lost seed phrases = permanent loss
- Traditional custody = trust third parties
- Multisig = complex coordination
- Hardware wallets = still lose if device breaks

**What if your wallet could recover itself?**

---

 The Solution

Safeseed is a **smart contract custody framework** that adds a safety layer to Safe wallets:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Your Safe Wallet (you maintain control)            │
│  ├─ SafeseedCustody (time-locked protection)       │
│  └─ SafeseedIntegration (emergency contacts)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

 Key Features

✅ **Time-Locked Protection** - Prevents instant asset drainage  
✅ **Emergency Recovery** - Trusted contacts can help restore access  
✅ **Non-Custodial** - You maintain full control  
✅ **Automated Setup** - Deploy entire system with one transaction  
✅ **Safe Compatible** - Works seamlessly with Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe)

 How It Works

```
1. Deploy SafeseedFactory
   ↓
2. Factory creates your SafeseedCustody + SafeseedIntegration
   ↓
3. Link to your Safe wallet
   ↓
4. Add emergency contacts
   ↓
5. Your assets are now protected with recovery options
```

**In Practice:**
- **Normal operations**: Use your Safe wallet as usual
- **Large transfers**: Time locks give you time to cancel if compromised
- **Lost access**: Emergency contacts can initiate recovery
- **Compromise detected**: Pause functionality and secure assets

 Quick Start

 Prerequisites

```bash
node >= 16.0.0
npm >= 8.0.0
```

 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Gavnor/Safeseed-Custody1.git
cd Safeseed-Custody1

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests (coming soon)
npx hardhat test

# Deploy locally
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hardhat
```

 Basic Usage

```javascript
// Deploy the entire system
const factory = await SafeseedFactory.deploy();
const tx = await factory.createSafeseedSystem(safeAddress, [emergencyContact1, emergencyContact2]);

// Your custody and integration contracts are now deployed and linked!
```
